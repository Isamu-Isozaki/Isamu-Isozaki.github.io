      <p>My name is Isamu Isozaki. I am currently an ambitious senior high school student who likes challenges. I take the international Baccaloriete. I apologize if I misspelt that. I go to an international school located in Japan. As recently I came to notice my poor memorization abilities and my failure to yet complete most of my projects, I decided to make this website to keep myself on track on what I want to do and what I hope to do onwards.</p>
      <p>I also want to get good grades on my IB hence I think I will write blogs about my progress as I'll like to keep track of that as well. However, as I recently noticed that writing matters that trouble me in a text format makes me happier, I think I will write those texts on this website as a mean to feel happy.</p>
      <p>On this site, I will also document my progress regarding college searchs. I plan to go to MIT yet this is not by any means a guarantee. At least I will do my best!</p>

      <h2>Why the "curiosity project"?</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>All of the content here are motived by pure curiosity. I will never give up on a project even if the project turned out not to be at a highschool level. In fact, as far as I am aware of, all of the projects are at least at an undergraduate level. This is because I found that to answer most questions which I am interested in where the answer is yet to be found, I tend to not be able to answer them without the help of some complex ideas. For example, to answer the question of finding how a cylinder tips when force is applied to it, I needed to use methods such as the Lagrange method not to mention all the differential equations.</p>
      <p>What I will document in the blog will be in regards to what I am curious about. Hence, they will essentially be miniprojects. Yes, I will take a project based approach in talking about getting good IB scores and getting into college. However, I will try to keep them as interesting and empirical as possible with at times even more dedication than shown in my projects. But as I do not think I am as skilled a Chemist as I am a Mathetician(even if I hope I am) the standards may be lower. I will also try to avoid philosophical discussions as I generally am not good at approaching philosophical topics without being radical. But if I think I can make an interesting point, I will still write about philosophy even if I may not be good at discussing it.</p>

      <h2>Are these extra curricular?</h2>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>Some of the projects, such as the JST project and the CAS projects, are purely extracurricular. However I am doing the Math IA(which is kind of like a research project in math) with the square magic squares and I will be doing my Extended Essay(which is like a thesis paper) on the subject of the cylinder tipping. However, I must note that, for what it is worth, I chose to study these questions out of curiosity rather than satisfying my academic record. I hope my content can demonstrate that!</p>

    <div class = "col-md-12">
      <p>I am glad you asked! I hope you all like it! I am a graduate from the frontend web development Nanodegree from a wonderful program named Udacity, and I am utilizing the skills I learned there to build this site. However, I am currently only using HTML and css thus far and I credit most of the beautiful design to a library called bootstrap. Hence, it is fair to say that I have not utilized almost all of the skills I learned in the Nanodegree. However, when I find a way to use them, I will use them without restraint!</p>
